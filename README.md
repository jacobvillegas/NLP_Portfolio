# General NLTK
#### NLP has many tools, that include spaCY, openNLP, and NLTK. These API provide the necessary functions to process text (tokinization, lementization). Here is a small game that utilize NLTK API.

# N-Grams
####  To build our language model, one of the fundamental pieces are n-grams, which is a continguous sequence of words or tokens for a given sample of text or speach. Here is a small example in building an n-gram (uni, bi-grams) dictionary and using this to classify text to sample in three different languages.

# Sentiment Analysis
#### Words convey information in many forms, and quite often we can gain valuable knowledge by the reactions of others. Sentiment analysis is used widely in commerical and online retail (Think of Amazon(R) reviews, and RottenTommmato movie reviews). WordNet and SentiNet are two API that help us work with senitment analysis. Here is an example of synset use and Sentiment Analysis:

# Parsers
#### Fundamentally in working with any corpora, how phrased and parts of speech are grouped togher give insight to the meaning of the text. Likewise parsing provides a means by which setenance strucure conveys meaning. Parser also help debug certain programs as sometimes sentance structure indicates that certain word orders with the same words can convey different meaning.  Here are an example of three utilized sentance parsers PSG, dependency and SRL:

# Scrapers
#### Scrapers is one means of obtaining a coropora and a knowledge bases. Scrapers, as their name implied are able to jump website to website and extract text, or be programmed to remove other detials. Here is a small example of a Webcrawler to obtain a knowledge base:

# Chatbot
#### A practical use of NLP has been Chatbot. These programs attempt to emulate human response and are used widely in business, specifically in customer service. The first known chatbot was ELIZA which mimicked a Rogerian Psychological Thereapist. With similar intent, here is a Chatbot that provides thereapy to the lonely by playing JEOPARDY.

# TEXT CLASSIFICATION
## SckitLearn API MODELS
#### Text Classification can be done in many ways. SciKit Learn is an API that provides machine learning (ML) tools and well as tools for text classification and predictive data analysis. Here is an example of using Scikit Learns Naive-Bayes, Logistic Regression and Neural Net models to complete a text classification of Tweets that could be signs of depression categorized as suicidal or non-suicidal:

## DEEP LEARNING
#### Tensorflow and Keras are one of the most well known API for developing Deep Learning ML modesl. Similary, as done previously, we have done another text categorization, however this time using Keras & Tensorflow to build a sequential model, RNN and utilize embeddings.

# Current Trends in NLP
#### In conclusion, there are many advances made in NLP. Many publications are posted with promising new ideas and novel methodologies to NLP. Here is a small sample from the Association of Computer Learning, in which a GPT-3 model was modeled to have cognative degredation by masking certain processesin the GPT-3 model. The results, by the author, provide a means to produce Alzheimer dementia like outputs that could be used in controls. A paper critique is provided
